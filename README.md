#SFML ASCII ART MAKER in C++

I tried to make this when I was so clueless about development and git. That's the reason why it's a mess.

*Am still gonna keep this because it reminds me of the pain C++ gave me*

*that's what happens when you choose CPP as a first language and don't have a proper goal or a roadmap lol*
